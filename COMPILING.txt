.cps

Use Cobra (http://www.cobrabytes.com/) to compile ".cps" sourcecode.

Dependencies are included in separate folders in this directory.

Dependencies should be compiled and copied into your "Cobra\bin\libs\" directory.

Source should be in the root of the directory (i.e. one level up from this "src" folder).

Compile and pack "hex.cps" and "viewer.cps" to get the executionables.
